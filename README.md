What I learned with this project:

- To print an elements ID: console.log(element.id);
- To print an elements class: console.log(element.className);
- CSS variables:
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49402471/how-to-use-javascript-variables-in-css
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/
- Had to remember that the web page will render the CSS class that is closest to the bottom of the file.
