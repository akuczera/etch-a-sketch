What I learned with this project:

- To print an elements ID: console.log(element.id);
- To print an elements class: console.log(element.className);
- CSS variables:
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49402471/how-to-use-javascript-variables-in-css
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/
- Had to remember that the web page will render the CSS class that is closest to the bottom of the file.
- Toggle a variable: https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/javascript+toggle+variable
- Saw an idea for a "flag variable". https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36398974/keep-prompting-the-user-a-number-until-it-falls-into-a-certain-range
